#### Requirements:
In order to run the project as developer or compile it, you will need **Node.js**.

Also if you want to work on the style you will need **Compass**.

#### Set up: 

Clone the repo. *If you are here I assume you know already a bit of git.*

When you are done clonning, install node modules:
```bash
npm install
```

When the modules are done installing:

Run *(for developer)*: 
```bash
npm start
```

Run *(to compile the project, it compiles (tries to) for all the platforms and all architectures)*:
```bash
node packager.js
```
the destination directory will be: 
```bash
../cocoChanelJS-dist
```
relative to the clone directory.


For the styles, run: 
```bash
compass watch
```

#### Q&A:
##### If I want to contribute? 
GO FOR IT, YESSSS ALL THE WAY !! 

##### What are the standards?
We are competing against comercial tools, you know the drill, the best for the best!!

#### The story (TM;DR):
We use at work Photoshop and realized that, I don't like it, is so complicated... and why is eating up 4GB of space ...
why a tool that was never purposed for web designing is doing just that? Makes no sense... and looked at the comunity, realized that we don't have a comunity web designer tool that's like a standard, like Photoshop.

I decided that, I want cocoChanelJS to be better than Photoshop, I want it to be free and forever. Standards are high but nothing's impossible.

For the moment, I am alone on the project, but I am open to have other people join in, create plugins, improve the core, make the tool the best in the world at what's purposed to be, a web designer. The best web designer.

#### Project status:
######Still aliveeee!!!  (working on it when i get free time)
