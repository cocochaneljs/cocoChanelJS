##Description:
It's an HTML designer. It's the begining, it will grow exponentially, allows plugins.


It's made for the ones who want to design web pages and not use proprietary softwares such as: Photoshop.

Many things will be changed to be better.

##Features:
  - Outliner:
    - Has tree hierarchy view up to 100 levels of depth. (too many :D)

  - Preview Pane:
    - Can select items on click.

  - New Design:
    - I will always improve on the app design, the idea is to be easy to use, and fast.

  - Full support for HTML:
    - Since it's an HTML environment, it's easier to get acurate preview of the page
