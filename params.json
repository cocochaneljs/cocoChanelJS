{"name":"cocoChanelJS","tagline":"The web-desinging tool you need!","body":"### Welcome to cocoChanelJS.\r\nHey! I am a programmer, who once thought: _\"What if we don't need to use Photoshop for websites design? Why all the tools that are for web-designers are built on a renderer that's simulating pages and not actually rendering them? Why tools like that need to cost a ton of money?\"_\r\n\r\nI found the solution: _\"Hey, I am a programmer , why don't I take this flaw and transform it into an opportunity to make every web-desinger's life easier?\"_ So I started to build this tool, it's easy to use, actively maintained (all on my free time), it's in HTML that builds HTML, no need **to install, just download open with your browser the file: \"index.html\" and voila!**\r\n\r\nTry stuff out, for the moment there's no tutorial on how to use it but it's mostly straight forward:\r\n***\r\n\r\n1. Select your element.\r\n\r\n2. Chose an action.\r\n\r\n3. Voila!\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please use Google Chrome (not yet tested in other browsers)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
